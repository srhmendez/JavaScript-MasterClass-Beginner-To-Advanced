I took this course for educational purposes. I feel like in order to keep moving forward as a Front-End Engineer I have to have a solid grasp on ES6 vanilla JavaScript, especially when it comes to frameworks. Most of this is review, but It never hurts to touch base and remember the building blocks that add up to great things. As an aspiring developer I take my personal study very seriously. I dedicate 1 hour a night (this is my non-negotiable learning commitment) to additional web development concepts because I want to be innovative. I want to make amazing things. I don't want to be an ok developer, I want to be an amazing developer. Good habits add up to success. If you've made it this far, I just want to tell you I am committed to growth.
